**Some additional insights that can be gleaned from the dashboard**:
-	The number of accidents is higher in the summer months than in the winter months. This may be due to a number of factors, such as increased traffic volume, more hours of daylight, and more people driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
-	The number of accidents is higher in urban areas than in rural areas. This is likely due to the fact that there are more drivers and pedestrians on the road in urban areas.
-	The number of accidents is higher on single carriageways than on dual carriageways. This may be due to the fact that single carriageways are often narrower and have lower speed limits than dual carriageways.
